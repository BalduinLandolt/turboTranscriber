## Acknowledgements

A Project of this size can't be created without looking up things, copy-pasting code, trying stuff out, and deleting again.
It's not possible to acknowledge every entry on Stackoverflow, every reply to issues on Github, etc. that I used to create TurboTranscriber.
However, some notable contributions and dependencies should be named.

### Standalone

The standalone version of TurboTranscriber was basically built around the beautiful [RSyntaxTextArea](https://github.com/bobbylight/RSyntaxTextArea) by bobbylight and the accompanying "Sister Projects" (see ibid.).

### Language Server

For the language server, I adapted a bunch of code from two main sources: The tree part blog post [Implementing a Language Serverâ€¦How Hard Can It Be??](https://medium.com/ballerina-techblog/implementing-a-language-server-how-hard-can-it-be-part-1-introduction-c915d2437076) by Nipuna Marcus on the one hand side.  
And on the other hand the XML Language Server [Lemminx](https://github.com/eclipse/lemminx), published by Eclipse and created/maintained first and foremost by Angelo Zerr.
